## Odd One Out

You are given an array of integers where every integer is repeated an even number of times except one. The "Odd One Out" is an integer that occurs an odd number times (Note, it could be an even or odd number). Find and return the integer that occurs an odd number of times.

Example:
arr = [8, 7, 3, 4, 7, 4, 5, 3, 5, 3, 3, 7, 8]

8 occurs two times
7 occurs three times
5 occurs two times
4 occurs two times
3 occurs four times

7 is the odd one out, since it occurs an odd number of times.




Array length can be up to 100 million.
There will be exactly one integer that occurs an odd number of times.
